# Project_Image-Classification-for-Object-Recognition
The objective of this project is to build an image classification model that can accurately identify and classify objects in images.

**Introduction**

This project focuses on image classification for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify images into these 10 classes, which include airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. This project involves the following steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing

Model Selection and Architecture

Model Training and Evaluation

Fine-tuning and Optimization

Model Deployment and Prediction


**Final Output Explanation**
The final output of the project demonstrates that the CNN model, after training and evaluation, is capable of classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into their respective classes. The classification report and sample predictions indicate the model's performance, showcasing its accuracy and ability to distinguish between different objects. The steps highlighted above, from data preprocessing to model deployment, provide a comprehensive approach to building an image classification system using deep learning techniques.
